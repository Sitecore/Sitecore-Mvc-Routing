MVC Routing with Sitecore
=========================
This project allows you to use `System.Web.Routing` routing engine (ala ASP.NET MVC) with Sitecore.

Building
--------
* Place your `Sitecore.Kernel.dll` in the '\lib' directory.
* Open the solution and build! 

Installation
------------
* Copy the include file from `\conf\App_Config\Include\MvcRouting.config` to the `\App_config\Includes` directory of your Sitecore installation.
* Copy the `Sitecore.MvcRouting.dll` to the `\bin` directory of your Sitecore installation.

Requirements
------------
* This code does not require ASP.NET MVC to be installed to be able to use the routing functionality.
* `System.Web.Routing` **must** be in the GAC. If you have .NET 3.5(SP1) or .NET 4.0 installed then its already there.

Usage Example
-----

###Global.asax###
This is where the magic happens, with MVC you define routes by using `MapRoute`. 
To work with Sitecore we have `MapSitecoreRoute` ..

    private static void RegisterRoutes(RouteCollection routes)
    {
        routes.MapSitecoreRoute("books", "{17E30F07-67D0-457F-9B18-B0B2DB435081}","{bookname}/{chapter}/{page}");
    }

    MapSitecoreRoute(<routeName>,<sitecoreItemId>,<routePatternUrl>);
    
.. the main difference here is we have to tell Sitecore which item we want to map these values to, also, we also dont want to hard-code a path incase a user decided to rename an item.
This is why we provide a GUID as the second parameter. It's a little ugly but it provides better protection against an item being moved or renamed.

We are still able to provide defaults for the matched values..

    routes.MapSitecoreRoute(
  	  	"books",
			  "{17E30F07-67D0-457F-9B18-B0B2DB435081}",
			  "{bookname}/{chapter}/{page}",
			  new { 
				  bookname = string.Empty,
				  chapter = string.Empty,
				  page = 1
				}
			);
      
You can also add regular `Ignore` paths, the routing resolver will not run if these paths match.

    routes.Ignore("books/");

You can add `Ignore` paths automatically by using this setting (default is `false`).

    <!-- Should the resolver add an automatic Ignore path for each matched route -->
    <setting name="MvcRouting.AddBaseIgnoreForRoutes" value="false" />
    
If this is set to `true` then, in this example, an Ignore of "books/" would be added to the `RouteCollection`.
This is very much dependant on how you want to set your application up.

###Retreiving values###

####XSLT####

**NOTE** : Remember to add the namespace `xmlns:scr="http://www.sitecore.net/mvc/routing"` at the top of your XSLT file
and add `scr` into the `exclude-result-prefixes` list.

You can retrieve individual values using `RouteDataValue(<name>)`  

    <div>
      Book Name : <xsl:value-of select="scr:RouteDataValue('bookname')"/> <br />
      Book Chapter : <xsl:value-of select="scr:RouteDataValue('chapter')"/> <br />
      Book Page : <xsl:value-of select="scr:RouteDataValue('page')"/> <br />
    </div>

You can retrieve the RouteData as an XPathNodeIterator using `RouteData()`

    <xsl:if test="scr:MatchedRoute()">
      <table border="1px">
        <tr>
          <th>Key</th>
          <th>Value</th>
        </tr>
        <xsl:for-each select="scr:RouteData()/@*">
          <tr>
            <td>
              <xsl:value-of select="name()" />
            </td>
            <td>
              <xsl:value-of select="." />
            </td>
          </tr>
        </xsl:for-each>
      </table>
    </xsl:if>

You can also retrieve the name of the currently matched route using `MatchedRoute()`

    <xsl:when test="scr:MatchedRoute() = 'books'">

See the `\doc\Example` directory for these quick examples.

Fork Me! / Todo
-----
I would like this to be a community effort so if you find this little bit of code useful and want to add anything to it
please feel free to fork this project and send me some pull requests for any improvements.

Just some quick notes to keep everything tidy :)

* Donâ€™t make changes to your local or remote master branches.
* Pull requests should always come from remote branches

Generally the recommended process is this :

1. Branch for a feature
2. Do some work and commit it
3. Checkout master and pull the latest
4. Checkout your branch and rebase on top of master
5. Run a build
6. Push your branch
7. Issue your pull request

###Things to be done###
 
* Add user controls to match the XSLT extension methods - Currently no support for using the RouteData in C# User Controls .. go on .. contrib something :D
